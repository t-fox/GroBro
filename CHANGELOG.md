## v2.0.0

⚠️ This is a major release with **breaking changes**. Please read carefully before upgrading.
+ Double-check and **update your configuration**
+ Remove any old Growatt devices from Home Assistant if you experience problems

### Breaking Changes

+ **Home Assistant auto-discovery** is now **device-based** (was previously global).
+ The following environment variables have been **deprecated**:
  + `REGISTER_FILTER` → replaced by automatic device detection and is removed
  + `ACTIVATE_COMMUNICATION_GROWATT_SERVER` → replaced by `GROWATT_CLOUD` with optional **selective forwarding** per device serial
+ **Sensor names may have changed**, and **additional sensors were added**.  

### New Environment Variables

+ `GROWATT_CLOUD`: Enables Growatt cloud communication with **selective forwarding**
+ `DEVICE_TIMEOUT`: Marks device as inactive after a specified timeout without data
+ `MAX_SLOTS`: Sets number of Home Assistant control timeslots for **NOAH batteries**

### New Features

+ Full codebase refactor
+ **Control support** for Inverters and Batteries
+ Added support for **NEXA-series batteries**

## v1.7.4

+ Enabled automatic selection of the correct register map based on device ID, deprecating the user-unfriendly `REGISTER_FILTER` variable.
+ Replaced `ACTIVATE_COMMUNICATION_GROWATT_SERVER` with `GROWATT_CLOUD`, enabling selective message forwarding via a comma-separated list.

## v1.7.3

+ Fix #52: missing ssl import in ha client

## v1.7.2

+ Fix broken shebang in run.sh
+ Add missing jq dependency in docker build

## v1.7.0
+ Introduced semantic versioning.
+ Refactoring for a new modular design.
+ Added a new unavailability option.

## v1.6
+ Large update of NOAH mappings.
+ Small fixes in message detection.

## v1.5
+ Updated the NOAH and NEO mappings.
+ Added a new message dump option, DUMP_MESSAGES=True, which writes all incoming messages to /data.
+ Introduced a LOG_LEVEL option for configurable logging.

## v1.4
Thanks to @justinh998 for adding two-way message forwarding to Growatt Cloud! 🎉

You can enable the relay by setting:
--env ACTIVATE_COMMUNICATION_GROWATT_SERVER=True

Note: Once enabled, your device can be controlled by Growatt. This can be seen as both a benefit and a potential risk, depending on your use case.

## v1.3
Use REGISTER_FILTER variable to set the right mapping for your Inverters and batteries.

Example: --env REGISTER_FILTER=QMN000XXXXXXXX:NEO800,YYYYYYYYXXXXX:NOAH

## v1.2
Good news, everyone!

In this release, NOAH-series batteries are now partially (mapping isn't complete yet) supported and will show up in Home Assistant as—yep, you guessed it—battery.

The updated register mapping results in a large number of new sensors appearing in Home Assistant. This will be addressed in the upcoming release through device-based register masks.

## v1.1
Added support for config messages and enhanced device information

## v1.0
Another try
