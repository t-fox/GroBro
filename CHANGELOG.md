## v2.7.6

### Bug Fixes
+ NEXA: Increased Max Values to 1000 in case Power+ Function is activated

## v2.7.5

### Bug Fixes
+ Reverted the 0x0103 holding register dump handler introduced in v2.7.3. It caused all-zero sensor readings for some users, disturbing automations. The original warning messages from unknown message type 259 will reappear in logs (#198)

## v2.7.4

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixed v2.7.3 regression: 0x0103 dumps no longer publish invalid config values like `charge_limit: 0` (#198)

## v2.7.3

### New Features
+ Added `KEEP_BATTERY_POSITION` option (default: off). When enabled, GroBro tracks NOAH battery serial numbers across position changes and logs a warning if the inverter stack re-enumerates and a battery moves to a different slot (#196)

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixed NEXA and NOAH devices crashing the parser every hour when sending holding register dumps (message type 0x0103) (#198)
+ Fixed NEXA household load sensors showing wrong values when the load is negative (e.g. exporting to grid). The registers are now parsed as signed values (#195)

## v2.7.2

### New Features
+ NEO 2000 inverters (4 MPPT inputs) now expose PV3 and PV4 voltage, current, and power sensors. Detection is automatic - GroBro compares total PV power against individual MPPT sums at runtime. No configuration needed (#182)
+ Added TL-XH2 inverter support (ZGQ serial prefix). The XH2 family shares the NEO register map and exposes grid import/export power, load power, battery state, BMS telemetry, and diagnostic sensors with XH2-specific names and publish defaults (#185)

### Bug Fixes
+ Added missing device class `battery` to individual battery SOC sensors for NOAH and SPF devices, so they display with colored badges in Home Assistant (#181)
+ Fixed NOAH battery devices being merged into one in Home Assistant. All NOAH devices report the same non-unique MAC address (`AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:XX`), which caused Home Assistant's device registry to treat them as the same device. The MAC is now validated and masked MACs like this are rejected and no longer used for device matching (#178)
+ Fixed missing TZ definition in German translation (#183)
+ Fixed `MAX_BAT=auto` showing phantom empty batteries, battery count is now read from the device's own `bat_cnt` register instead of relying solely on serial-number register presence (#187)

## v2.6.2

### New Features
+ `MAX_BAT=auto` is now the default. The number of battery packs is detected automatically. You can still override with `MAX_BAT=1`, `MAX_BAT=2`, etc.
+ Battery serial numbers are now combined into a single sensor per battery (`Bat2/3/4 Serial`) instead of 4 separate part-sensors. Battery 1 uses the device serial ("Device SN").
+ PTQ inverters (NEO 1000M-X via LoRa) behind ShineWeLink dongles are now extracted from config messages and registered as separate NEO devices in Home Assistant, with modbus data routed to them automatically.

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixed MQTT topic serial containing control characters being used as HA device identifier
+ Fixed ShineWeLink config messages (type 0x0129, function 0x29) being silently dropped

## v2.5.2

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixed NOAH FE19 config messages using the config's serial number (data logger serial) as HA device identifier instead of the MQTT topic serial. This caused multiple devices behind a shared data logger to be merged into one device in Home Assistant (#178)

## v2.5.1

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixed regression where NOAH message dispatcher consumed ALL device types' function 3 (holding register) and function 16 (preset multiple) messages, causing them to never reach the modbus parser. This broke NEO, NEXA, and SPF devices that send these function codes.

## v2.5.0

### New Features
+ Added `MAX_BAT` environment variable to control how many battery packs appear in Home Assistant. For example, `MAX_BAT=1` hides all but the first battery module. Set it to match how many batteries your system actually has.
+ Added `FILTER_DATA_GLITCHES` option (default: off) to prevent glitches on total_increasing sensors after a device reconnects (#154)
+ Added 37 missing NOAH input registers: PV1/PV2 temperature, battery SOH, PV3/PV4 voltage/current/temperature, battery 1 serial number, all battery warning and protection statuses, work mode, charging status/power, fault status, AC couple statuses, CT/grid/household load registers, system temperature, and cell voltage limits
+ Parser now supports the `mult` field (in addition to `float_options`) for simpler register definitions
+ Added support for ShineWeLink-X2 data loggers (RAQ serial prefix). These dongles bridge LoRa-connected inverters like the NEO 1000M-X into MQTT. Their messages are now properly routed, including config telemetry (firmware version, serial number).
+ Added parser for new message type `0x6F64` (EcoTracker JSON data). EcoTracker sensor data is now forwarded to HA instead of being silently dropped (#176)

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixed missing `device_class: voltage` for Output Voltage sensor
+ Removed duplicate `out_voltage` register definition
+ Added `VENDOR_100` to modbus function enum and downgraded unknown function log from INFO to DEBUG to reduce log noise (#176)
+ Fixed NOAH config messages (FE19) not being processed - firmware version, serial number and other device info are now properly saved in Home Assistant

## v2.4.0

### New Features
+ Added NEXA register to allow grid charging

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixed wrong NEXA battery 1 temperature reading (#162)
+ Fixed bug which always blocks config messages from Growatt cloud

## v2.3.0

### New Features
+ Added most of the NEXA 2000 config and holding registers that were still missing (#157)
+ Improved logging for MQTT config (#55)

### Bug Fixes
+ NEXA: "Battery Count" and "Battery Cycle Count" should be INT, not FLOAT (#161)

## v2.2.0

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixed NOAH battery temperature accuracy by correcting offsets and mapping
+ Fixed NOAH battery temperature display to show "unknown" instead of stale data when offline
+ Fixed missing `AVAILABILITY_SENSOR` configuration in the Home Assistant add-on (#132)
+ Fixed message parsing order to prevent read from wrong parser
+ Improved logging for configuration read responses and general system events

### New Features
+ Added `GROWATT_CLOUD_CONFIG_FILTER` option to prevent the Growatt Cloud from remotely changing datalogger settings (#38)
+ Added interactive control features: Datalogger restart button and Time Synchronization button (#122) and (#81)
+ Added ability to configure the data reporting interval
+ Added configurable MQTT Client IDs to allow running multiple GroBro instances in parallel (#142)
+ Added support for reading configuration messages and updated all register maps with config controls
+ Enhanced UI with updated control icons for configuration settings
+ Added `TZ` option to HA-Addon to set the desired time zone for logging (#149)

## v2.1.0

### Bug Fixes

+ Fixed pydantic warnings on startup
+ Continue with local message processing if cloud forwarding fails
+ Fixed object_id deprecated messages in HA

### New Features

+ Added support for SPF models (via Shine WiFi X dongle)
+ Added smart mode (NOAH) which works only in connection with Growatt cloud again
+ Extended NOAH device infos
+ Added option to expose device availability via dedicated online sensor and to send sensor states retain via MQTT

## v2.0.1

### Bug Fixes

+ Subscribe to MQTT topic again after broken connection

### New Features

+ Added possibility to select the smart mode for slots of a NOAH

## v2.0.0

⚠️ This is a major release with **breaking changes**. Please read carefully before upgrading.
+ Double-check and **update your configuration**
+ Remove any old Growatt devices from Home Assistant if you experience problems

### Breaking Changes

+ **Home Assistant auto-discovery** is now **device-based** (was previously global).
+ The following environment variables have been **deprecated**:
  + `REGISTER_FILTER` → replaced by automatic device detection and is removed
  + `ACTIVATE_COMMUNICATION_GROWATT_SERVER` → replaced by `GROWATT_CLOUD` with optional **selective forwarding** per device serial
+ **Sensor names may have changed**, and **additional sensors were added**.  

### New Environment Variables

+ `GROWATT_CLOUD`: Enables Growatt cloud communication with **selective forwarding**
+ `DEVICE_TIMEOUT`: Marks device as inactive after a specified timeout without data
+ `MAX_SLOTS`: Sets number of Home Assistant control timeslots for **NOAH batteries**

### New Features

+ Full codebase refactor
+ **Control support** for Inverters and Batteries
+ Added support for **NEXA-series batteries**

## v1.7.4

+ Enabled automatic selection of the correct register map based on device ID, deprecating the user-unfriendly `REGISTER_FILTER` variable.
+ Replaced `ACTIVATE_COMMUNICATION_GROWATT_SERVER` with `GROWATT_CLOUD`, enabling selective message forwarding via a comma-separated list.

## v1.7.3

+ Fix #52: missing ssl import in ha client

## v1.7.2

+ Fix broken shebang in run.sh
+ Add missing jq dependency in docker build

## v1.7.0
+ Introduced semantic versioning.
+ Refactoring for a new modular design.
+ Added a new unavailability option.

## v1.6
+ Large update of NOAH mappings.
+ Small fixes in message detection.

## v1.5
+ Updated the NOAH and NEO mappings.
+ Added a new message dump option, DUMP_MESSAGES=True, which writes all incoming messages to /data.
+ Introduced a LOG_LEVEL option for configurable logging.

## v1.4
Thanks to @justinh998 for adding two-way message forwarding to Growatt Cloud! 🎉

You can enable the relay by setting:
--env ACTIVATE_COMMUNICATION_GROWATT_SERVER=True

Note: Once enabled, your device can be controlled by Growatt. This can be seen as both a benefit and a potential risk, depending on your use case.

## v1.3
Use REGISTER_FILTER variable to set the right mapping for your Inverters and batteries.

Example: --env REGISTER_FILTER=QMN000XXXXXXXX:NEO800,YYYYYYYYXXXXX:NOAH

## v1.2
Good news, everyone!

In this release, NOAH-series batteries are now partially (mapping isn't complete yet) supported and will show up in Home Assistant as—yep, you guessed it—battery.

The updated register mapping results in a large number of new sensors appearing in Home Assistant. This will be addressed in the upcoming release through device-based register masks.

## v1.1
Added support for config messages and enhanced device information

## v1.0
Another try
